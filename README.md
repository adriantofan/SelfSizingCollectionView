SelfSizingCollectionView
========================

a issue demo with self sizing UICollectionView

The issue is that when one sets UICollectionViewFlowLayout's estimatedItemSize the scrolling is breacks.

A very simple collection view should display 40 item. Instead it shows only 32.

The demo strted with a Swift implementation. At this point it also contains an Objective-c version.
