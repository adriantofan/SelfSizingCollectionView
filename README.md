SelfSizingCollectionView
========================

a issue demo with self sizing `UICollectionView`

The issue is that when one sets `UICollectionViewFlowLayout`'s estimatedItemSize the scrolling  breaks.

A very simple collection view should display 40 item. Instead it shows only 32.

The demo started with a Swift implementation. At this point it also contains an Objective-c version.
